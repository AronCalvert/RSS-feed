    "content_html": "<p>The theory that the Irish capitalists are just mere servants of international capital keeps the true nature of the Irish bosses hidden.</p><p>Why would you let the Irish rich hide? That\u2019s what the theory of them being a \u201ccomprador\u201d class does. This theory says that the Irish bourgeoisie are \u201cmere\u201d servants of multinational capital and extract profits from the Irish workforce into the pockets of foreign capitalists. The problem with the theory is not the fact that the Irish rich do work hand in hand with multinational capital but that the theory hides the role the Irish rich play in exploiting workers in Ireland and around the world to fill their own pockets. They are junior partners.</p><p>Let\u2019s be clear - it\u2019s not about denying the skewed nature of the Irish economy. Around 70 US companies employ more than 200,000 people, with a further 168,000 indirect jobs in the supply of products and services. That\u2019s still a minority of jobs but it\u2019s significant and the Irish government has become over reliant on tax revenues from those multinationals, which they use to build up the local rich. The Irish rich work hand in hand with the multinationals and there are several key multinationals that are Irish owned and exploit workers across the globe. So the Irish rich don\u2019t just extract profits from workers in Ireland and hand them over to foreign capitalists. Our bosses exploit workers everywhere and often help to realise profits that have actually been produced around the world and just booked in Ireland.</p><p>The bourgeoisie of the 26 counties are a small but self-standing capitalist class that have their own autonomous state machine and they have to be overthrown by a workers\u2019 revolution. You see, the secret of the \u201ccomprador\u201d theory is that it\u2019s a reformist attempt to leave open the prospect of alliances with sections of the local boss class against multinational capital. The UCD academic and author Conor McCabe explicitly ends his book \u201cSins of the Father\u201d, which heavily relies on the comprador analysis, with a call to emulate the failed Greek radical left party Syriza by electing a social democratic government that would focus on building up a native industrial base.</p><p>Let\u2019s look at the theory and see if it\u2019s backed up by the facts of the Irish economy. In the 1970s Sinn F\u00e9in argued that Ireland was a \u201cneo-colony\u201d and was dominated by British capitalism. They also argued that the Irish rich were a comprador class merely administering the country for the British capitalists and therefore it was possible to have a \u201cpan-nationalist\u201d alliance consisting of Sinn F\u00e9in, Fianna F\u00e1il and the SDLP. This allowed the Irish rich to hide their own economic and political power while leaving open the prospect of alliance with the party of the Irish capitalists, Fianna F\u00e1il, whose grassroots consisted of small Irish employers.</p><p>At the time former Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams set out this position Ireland was one of the poorest countries in Europe but the structure of Irish capitalism and its role in the world had changed since independence and has changed since the 1970s. It\u2019s true that Ireland\u2019s industrial advances had been crushed by British Imperialism over centuries. Irish industry was growing in the 1700s but by the early 1800s competition from British industry had wiped out Irish industry, while British landlords extracted massive rents from the country. They made Ireland into an agricultural appendage of industrial Britain brutally policed by the forces of the Empire.</p><p>But the Irish rich existed even at that time and cooperated with the British occupation to help the British fill their pockets but also to fill their own pockets too. The eventual battle for liberation from the Empire saw men from opposite sides of the class war both demanding their own visions of liberation. For Irish employers like William Martin Murphy it was an Ireland where the exploitation of the workers and peasants was conducted by men like himself. For socialist hero James Connolly the Irish workers wouldn\u2019t be free until they owned everything themselves. The Irish employers applauded the execution of Connolly. After all, they\u2019d fought his campaigning tooth and nail during the Lock Out of 1913.</p><p>There weren\u2019t many like James Connolly and he left behind no political party of revolutionaries, the Labour Party was a pale pink shadow of radicalism. The War of Independence saw workers take mass militant action, with general strikes in Belfast and Dublin and the declaration of the Limerick Soviet, but the Irish boss class came out on top of the cross class movement for independence. Partition was a means to weaken the working class and was accepted by the incoming and authoritarian Cumann na nGaedheal government, who shot republicans without trial and used British guns during the Civil War.</p><p>At this stage the faction of the Irish bourgeoisie that was in power did act as an agent of British capital in Ireland. Only 4% of workers worked in industry and most exports were agricultural. Cumann na nGaedeal wanted a free trade policy that would allow the big farmers to export to Britain. But when Fianna F\u00e1il were elected in 1932 they fought to expand a centre of Irish capital accumulation. They wanted to defend local employers and keep workers quiet by offering jobs and housing. They stopped paying land annuities to Britain, brought in tariffs and introduced the Control of Manufactures Act - which ruled out foreign capitalists owning the majority shares in a company in Ireland or having the majority of seats on any company board.</p><p>The government did have the right to grant licences to foreign companies though, with just 74 licences granted between 1932 and 1941. The tariff and company control policies initially led to some moderate industrial development. There had also been an \u201ceconomic war\u201d with Britain from 1932 to 1938 with the British, weakened during the World Wars and facing revolt in colonies like India, writing off the land annuities. In 1935 Fianna F\u00e1il had signed the \u201cCoal-Cattle Pact\u201d with Britain, showing that you could only build on what you\u2019ve inherited from the past. The Irish economy was changing but was still skewed towards agriculture.</p><p>The global economic crisis of the 1930s was only resolved for the capitalists when the massive destruction of capital during the Second World War led to a post-war boom. The cheapening of capital and workers led to a huge leap in the rate of profit, which only later started to fall again. This two decades long boom across the whole Western world would come crashing down in the early 1970s as the inner crisis tendencies of capitalism asserted themselves again. But the opening up of the Irish economy to this boom transformed the economy. The Control of Manufactures Act was repealed and an Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement was signed. The majority of new foreign owned companies were still British, but that began to shift as capital flowed into Ireland and new Irish businesses were born.</p><p>When Ireland joined the European Economic Community in 1973 the world economy was already beginning to crash. Entry into the EEC led to investments from the US and Japan, as companies wanted to get around EEC tariffs. Soon Ireland was the key destination for US capital. At the time, parties like the Workers Party welcomed the US multinationals because the local bourgeoisie were \u201clazy\u201d. They failed to see how the local bourgeoisie were doing what the capitalists of all small countries did - integrating themselves into the preexisting hierarchies of imperialism as junior partners, not as mere servants. The bottom line for any bourgeois class is profit. Where profit leads, capital follows. Hundreds of new Irish companies sprang up, most small, but some became giants. Others, established in the years before, began to access global markets.</p><p>Irish corporation Cement Roadstone Holdings (CRH) was established in 1970 through the merger of Cement Limited (which was established in 1936) and Roadstone Limited (est. 1949). They now have 80,000 workers in 4,000 locations across 30 countries and had a reported net income of $3.5 billion in 2024 alone. CRH owned a 25% stake in Mashav, the holding company for Nesher Cement, which was Israel\u2019s sole cement supplier for the notorious Apartheid Wall. CRH have interests all over the globe that they want protected and this, not subordination to imperialism, drives the anti-neutrality stance of the Irish rich. They want the EU or the US military to secure the globe for capital accumulation to proceed. They exploit the workers of 30 countries.</p><p>The Kerry Group was founded in 1972. They have over 21,000 workers operating in 150 locations across 54 countries. They declared a global profit after tax of \u20ac734.4 million in 2024. The company was ranked near the bottom of the \u201cCorporate Human Rights Benchmark\u201d, scoring just 18.4 out of 100. It got just 1.7 out of 10 for transparency in identifying and addressing human rights risks. The Kerry Group\u2019s own internal assessments admit \u201csalient\u201d human rights risks across its global operations including the need to address forced labour, child labour, and lack of freedom to unionise. In Madagascar\u2019s vanilla industry, national surveys in 2011 and in 2012 estimated that nearly 32% of the industry\u2019s workforce consisted of children aged 12 to 17 years old. Criticism has made these corporations more careful in recent years but they draw their profits from an international pool of workers across 54 countries.</p><p>Irish company Smurfit Kappa dates back to the protectionist period and was set up in 1934 as a small box-making factory in Rathmines, Dublin. Now called \u201cSmurfit Westrock\u201d they\u2019ve over 100,000 workers in 40 countries. They\u2019ve more than 500 locations and operate 60 paper mills. In September 2025, the company reported a whopping net income for the year of $748 million. Smurfit Westrock was sued in a Milan court by 363 businesses seeking \u20ac400 million in damages. The case alleged overcharging resulting from long-term conspiracies in the cardboard market. This followed a \u20ac124 million fine imposed by Italian authorities in 2019 for anti-competitive practices and for forming a cartel to push up prices.</p><p>They were also up in court in the USA for conspiring with other cardboard manufacturers to coordinate price increases. It was claimed this conspiracy led to a 30% increase in packaging costs over 5 years. They acted as a cartel and the price of all goods that required packaging would increase as a result. The Italian court case shows that our bourgeoisie are somebody else\u2019s evil multinational. To workers in Italy this Irish company is an evil multinational. Workers at their factories in Peru had to strike to get the right to join a union. The Unite Union in Britain had to fight the company for paying workers below the legal minimum wage. They suck profit out of 100,000 workers all over the world.</p>",

    "content_html": "<p>Security worker Francis O\u2019Reilly explains.</p><p>Revolutionaries aren\u2019t against winning reforms. We want our class to fight as hard as we can for every scrap we can win under capitalism. But reformism is a philosophy that says all we should do is fight for reforms. A reformist believes that capitalism can be slowly changed into a better system.</p><p>The revolutionary engages in campaigns on day to day issues to empower the workers involved in those campaigns so that they can start to open up to the idea of a system beyond the current exploitative system. Reformists think that each reform won changes the system. They don\u2019t.</p><p>In modern politics, reformism is often associated with Social Democracy - Labour style parties, where the goal is to humanise capitalism through a strong welfare state, workers\u2019 rights, and wealth redistribution. Revolutionaries don\u2019t object to fighting for any of those things. But we know the system will roll them back as soon as struggle drops.</p><p>Reformism is the basic thesis of soft left reformist politics and has it\u2019s roots in the working class movement itself, in trade union bureaucracy - not just in the elected chambers. The trade union bureaucracy are paid far more than rank and file workers and they mediate between capital and labour, giving them the illusion of having their feet under the table of power.</p><p>They\u2019re being duped by the boss class and its political representatives. The last 40 years, of Thatcherite policies, have been decades of assault on the working class. Previous reforms get rolled back.</p><p>Reformism comes in many shapes and sizes - from Robert Owen (who set up a co-operative movement) to the Chartist Movement (workers demanding the vote) and to the enormous Social Democratic Party in Germany, which ended up supporting their ruling class and the madness of the war drive before World War 1.</p><p>Most recently we\u2019ve seen the likes of Podemos and Syriza and various Labour Party\u2019s in power across Europe. Every single time they fail to change the system or implement even their most modest proposals. Surely this can\u2019t be just a personal failing on the part of their politicians every single time?</p><p>Left reformists believe in limited worker protests and even using strikes to get into government and like to create the illusion that change can come from the top by putting forward sensible proposals and having gentlemens debate with the deep state. But the working class is called upon to back up the reformists when they get into trouble.</p><p>For revolutionaries the failure of the Greek radical left party Syriza is the most spectacular, because over 10 years ago Europe was shifting left and the Right2Water movement here in Ireland was pushing back privatisation and in Italy and in Spain workers and communities were fighting back against the police and technocrats (from Brussels).</p><p>After 32 general strikes in Greece the Greek workers voted in Syriza in huge numbers, but straight away Syriza formed a government with an anti-immigration party called the Greek Independents, and gave them the Ministry of Defence, like the mistake Allende made in 1973 in Chile, showing his weakness by having General Pinochet at the Cabinet Table.</p><p>Europe bullied Syriza into a \u20ac9 billion austerity program and they went back to Greece and called a referendum on the package, which put Brussels on the back foot.</p><p>The whole of Europes anti-austerity movement held its breath waiting for the referendum results. 61% voted against the cuts proposed by the EU Finance Ministers and the celebrations were wild. Could Syriza be the first reformist party to truly challenge international capitalism and unite Europes workers and radical anti-austerity movements?</p><p>No. Syriza pushed through a far worse austerity program (than the one demanded by Brussels) and devastated the hopes of Greek people and international solidarity. You cannot reform capitalism from within. Every time people say it will be different and every time it\u2019s the exact same result.</p><p>What are the lessons for workers who put their faith in parties like Sinn F\u00e9in and the Social Democrats for change? And how do we revolutionaries relate to the desire for an alternative, to finally have a government in Ireland without Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael?</p><p>First off all a government without FF and FG would be a first time historic shift in Irish politics and of course any future Red TD would nominate Mary Lou McDonald for An Taoiseach.</p>",

    "content_html": "<p>The horrible 100 year long history of the A-team of Irish capitalism</p><p>When Eamonn DeValera led Fianna F\u00e1il into the D\u00e1il after the June 1927 election the newly elected Fianna F\u00e1il TDs had revolvers in their pockets. They seemed like radical gunslingers, the smell of gunsmoke still on their jackets. DeValera had broken with Sinn F\u00e9in to form Fianna F\u00e1il and make his way back to parliamentary politics. The new party had an aura of radicalism, helped by a panicked establishment press which tried to paint Dev and his gunmen as \u2018communists\u2019 and \u2018Bolsheviks\u2019 - but they were no such thing.</p><p>DeValera would soon own some of the most influential newspapers in Ireland, and in the 1930s he sat down with Archbishop McQuaid to write a conservative constitution, which was adopted in 1937. Soon Fianna F\u00e1il were the establishment - the party to court with a brown envelope stuffed with cash if you wanted land rezoned or to get your hands on taxpayer cash to fund your new business.</p><p>Between them the two right wing parties, Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, ruled the roost for decades. Political debate was suffocating, a charade of choosing between one right wing set of policies or another. It seemed like this right wing consensus could never be broken. We were trapped in an endlessly repeating cycle of Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael.</p><p>The 2020 election in Ireland was truly historic. There was a tidal wave vote for change. In the working class areas there was a huge vote for Sinn F\u00e9in and a significant vote for the radical left. Even Sinn F\u00e9in were shocked at the level of support they got - they hadn\u2019t run enough candidates to scoop up all the potential votes. People were sick to death of the two-party system, exchanging Fianna F\u00e1il for Fine Gael or vice versa.</p><p>The election opened up the possibility of Ireland\u2019s first \u201cleft government\u201d. \u201cVote left, transfer left\u201d became a key slogan of the election and this was evident in the extent of Sinn F\u00e9in transfers that went to the radical left. But all that hope was dashed when the Green Party went into coalition with the two main right wing parties, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, who had dominated Irish politics since the foundation of the state. People were frustrated and furious. Since then the establishment has been able to use immigration as a wedge issue to chip away at Sinn F\u00e9in support.</p><p>The recent Presidential election again showed a strong vote for change. But why has Ireland been a two-party state for a century?</p><p>Fianna F\u00e1il was founded by Eamonn DeValera in 1926 and he led them into the D\u00e1il in 1927. DeValera had led the anti-treaty IRA but wanted to get back into mainstream political life. The new party tried to present itself as a \u2018national movement\u2019 - open to all classes. DeValera was careful to court workers, and stole the thunder of the weak Labour Party.</p><p>The Fianna F\u00e1il economic policy was \u2018protectionist\u2019 - they were for building up native industry behind a wall of protective trade tariffs. This differentiated them from Cumann na nGaedheal who wanted to maintain trade links with Britain. With the union leaders and Labour Party reluctant to challenge Irish capitalism, Fianna F\u00e1il were able to convince workers that protectionism would offer more jobs and a better economy.</p><p>When Fianna F\u00e1il spoke out against capitalism it was always British capitalism that was the problem, not our own Irish bosses. They were able to capture working class anger after the global crash of 1929 and focus it within this nationalist framework. When unemployment rose - it was the British! When poverty rose - it was the British! It certainly was the case that the legacy of Imperialism had retarded the Irish economy, but it was also the case that we had our own layer of elite exploiters.</p><p>In most countries in Europe there is a clear left/right divide. There are right wing parties like the British Tories, who represent the wealthiest capitalists and landlords, and there are Social Democratic or Labour parties who are supposed to represent the working class, but fail to. So in Britain the Labour Party had thousands of working class organisations affiliated to it - it was seen as the natural political home for workers.</p><p>In Ireland the legacy of the Empire meant that nationalist freedom fighters were able to capture working class support for Irish capitalism. Irish workers weren\u2019t just duped, they were promised economic advances by Fianna F\u00e1il and genuinely believed their anti-British rhetoric. After all, 800 years of cruel British oppression, with the partition of the country leaving a chunk in the hands of Imperialism, meant there was a progressive or anti-Imperial side to the nationalism of Irish workers.</p><p>But it was being used by a ruling class faction to get workers to support their own local exploiters. Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s protectionist economic policy was giving voice to the needs of a whole class of small factory owners who couldn\u2019t compete on the open market with the larger and more established British companies. And they successfully wed workers to this capitalist led \u2018national movement\u2019.</p><p>In the 1932 election Fianna F\u00e1il won enough seats to form a government, with support from the Labour Party. Cumann na nGaedheal helped Fianna F\u00e1il appear more radical than they were by stirring up a red scare and insinuating that DeValera was getting his orders from Communists in Russia. Fianna F\u00e1il became the political home for many Dublin workers who were unimpressed with the Labour Party.</p><p>Once in power Fianna F\u00e1il took some progressive measures - like ending land annuity payments to the British. They also established many Irish state companies like Aer Lingus and Bord na M\u00f3na. But driving the Irish state machine required utilising the power of the Church to keep workers in line. DeValera understood this, and despite being excommunicated for opposing the treaty, he courted the Church hierarchy eventually working with the bishops to write the 1937 constitution.</p><p>They balanced strengthening the counter revolutionary state with throwing crumbs to workers to keep them on board. They introduced the right to collective bargaining for workers at the same time as banning women from many industries, effectively dividing the working class. Elite opposition to Fianna F\u00e1il still existed in the form of the far right Blueshirt movement, led by ex-Garda commissioner Eoin O\u2019Duffy. The union leaders used the rise of the Blueshirts to justify jumping into bed with Fianna F\u00e1il.</p>",

    "content_html": "<p>The working class in Ireland needs revolutionary politics to win but Trotskyism doesn\u2019t provide it.</p><p>It\u2019s time to leave Trotskyism in the dustbin of history. To many this will seem like a left bubble debate but all the main forces on the Irish socialist left come from the Trotskyist tradition. If you want to understand the Irish left you can\u2019t ignore Trotskyism. The Socialist Workers\u2019 Network runs People Before Profit and is a sister organisation to the British Socialist Workers\u2019 Party, part of the International Socialist Tendency. The Socialist Party and the so-called Revolutionary Communists both emerged from the Militant tendency, another British Trotskyist movement that spent many years inside the British Labour Party.</p><p>I want to argue that Trotskyism is the left wing of the middle class left. It\u2019s not a working class ideology. Its job is to unconsciously sabotage the working class movement. It\u2019s as far as you can travel towards real working class Marxism while still standing in the shoes of the middle class. That\u2019s not to say that Leon Trotsky didn\u2019t occasionally say interesting or worthwhile things and there\u2019s no point denying the role he played as president of the St. Petersburg Soviet in 1905 and again in 1917, the leading role he played in the 1917 October Revolution or in the building of the revolutionary Red Army. Everyone should read his \u201cHistory of the Russian Revolution\u201d. But many of his political flaws continue today in many of his supporters.</p><p>There are many good individual Trotskyist activists. They mostly join whatever organisation they encounter first and then adopt its politics wholesale. Even the best of those individuals, as this article will explain, damage the left whether they know they\u2019re doing it or not. We need a return to the actual revolutionary working class politics of the Bolsheviks - a return to fighting to build a working class party that while embedded in the wider struggles of our class holds onto principled politics. Trotskyism involves a distortion and falsification of Lenin. I don\u2019t intend to do a comprehensive overview of Trotsky\u2019s entire output but will highlight those aspects of his approach that still inform the modern Trotskyist left.</p><p>Let\u2019s start with some of the political weaknesses inherent in Leon Trotsky himself. Like most Russian activists who came into activity in the years of rising struggle in the 1890s he helped to build workers\u2019 unions. He helped build the South Russian Workers\u2019 Union. He was initially attracted to Lenin\u2019s principled \u201cIskra\u201d group, who were known as the most orthodox and most revolutionary of Russian Marxists. Lenin was fighting for all the separate circles and factions that had grown out of the rising strike movement to unite into one socialist party with a clear revolutionary programme.</p><p>At the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the first real meeting of all these separate circles, the new party split into two main factions: the revolutionary Bolsheviks and the reformist Mensheviks. Leon Trotsky went into the room promising to defend Lenin but dropped his principles over the hurt feelings of some older famous intellectuals. The Mensheviks refused to subordinate these famous intellectuals to collective party democracy. Trotsky left the meeting in the opportunist Menshevik camp. \u201cThe Congress,\u201d said Trotsky \u201chas neither the moral nor the political right to refashion the editorial board. It is too delicate a question\u201d. A party conference can\u2019t vote to remove intellectuals from a leading body because it would hurt their feelings? It\u2019s \u201ctoo delicate a question\u201d to ask each candidate to show their work and outline their political line? Lenin later explained the stakes:</p><p>\u201cThe issue thus came down to this: circles or a party? Were the rights of delegates to be restricted at the Congress in the name of the imaginary rights or rules of the various bodies and circles, or were all lower bodies and old groups to be completely, and not nominally but actually, disbanded in face of the Congress, pending the creation of genuinely Party official institutions?\u201d</p><p>The intellectuals weren\u2019t willing to subordinate their egos to the collective democracy of a united party. They wanted to keep their separate circles. They called Lenin \u201cRobespierre\u201d (the French revolutionary) and said he was a \u201cdictator\u201d because he argued they should respect the collective democracy of the party. The future Menshevik leader Julius Martov suggested a formulation of party membership that was so broad any worker could have claimed to be a member - but this would have created such a loose party that there would be no discipline. Formally it sounded like a \u201cbroad\u201d membership base was better, in fact it would have allowed indiscipline to reign supreme. How could any revolution coordinate mass struggles against a state as monstrous as the Tsarist dictatorship without a cohesive organisation leading those struggles?</p><p>Lenin understood that while it sounded like a pro-worker formulation Martov\u2019s idea of a broad party was actually about helping the intellectuals stay in their small circles and disrupt working class discipline: \u201cIn words, Martov\u2019s formulation defends the interests of the broad strata of the proletariat, but in fact it serves the interests of the bourgeois intellectuals, who fight shy of proletarian discipline and organisation.\u201d Lenin\u2019s idea was for a tight organisation of revolutionaries who were organically embedded in wider struggle, lending the wider struggle organizational cohesion and revolutionary political guidance.</p><p>After the split the Mensheviks counterposed Lenin\u2019s politics to the \u201cself-training of the proletariat\u201d in struggle. This sounded very bottom up and is repeated to this day by many Trotskyist groups, particularly People Before Profit. Lenin saw through it, it was a con job: \u201cThe proletariat will do nothing to have the worthy professors and high-school students who do not want to join an organisation recognised as Party members merely because they work under the control of an organisation. The proletariat is trained for organisation by its whole life, far more radically than many an intellectual prig. Having gained some understanding of our programme and our tactics, the proletariat will not start justifying backwardness in organisation by arguing that the form is less important than the content. It is not the proletariat, but certain intellectuals in our Party who lack self-training in the spirit of organisation and discipline, in the spirit of hostility and contempt for anarchistic talk.\u201d</p><p>The whole concept of \u201cself-training of the proletariat\u201d was a way for the intellectual wing of the movement to claim to workers that the workers didn\u2019t need clear politics and a disciplined party of their own. According to the Mensheviks a loose party thrown into struggle after struggle was supposed to automatically produce worker leaders, in fact it disarmed them. Lenin understood this would not be the case and that without an organisation of worker leaders the working class would remain subordinate to the liberal opposition to the Tsar. Lenin understood the secret: the middle class within the Marxist left was disarming the workers for the middle class outside the working class left to then take over and actually lead the movement.</p><p>The whole \u201cself-training of the proletariat\u201d line saw the Mensheviks reach back into the poverty stricken theories of what was called \u201cEconomism\u201d - a reformist trend that many of the Menshevik leaders had previously joined Lenin in criticising. Lenin had written his famous booklet \u201cWhat Is To Be Done?\u201d against Economism, arguing against the idea that merely organising unions or going on strike would by itself create worker leaders. But now the Mensheviks needed a stick to beat Lenin with and refused to discuss the real issues at hand. Lenin was personally slandered, the real debate (about party discipline and democracy) was hidden behind a fog of gross misrepresentation. Leon Trotsky was chosen by the Mensheviks to attack Lenin in a pamphlet.</p><p>Trotsky wrote: \u201cThe year which has just passed has been a year which has weighed heavily in the life of our Party\u2026 But the basic task\u2026 may in general be formulated as consisting of the development of the self-activity of the proletariat.\u201d Trotsky argued that the: \u201cwatchword \u2018self-activity of the proletariat\u2019 became a living and, let us hope, life-giving slogan.\u201d Trotsky also argued that subordination to party democracy would lead to dictatorship: \u201cIn the internal politics of the Party these methods lead, as we shall see below, to the Party organisation \u201csubstituting\u201d itself for the Party, the Central Committee substituting itself for the Party organisation, and finally the dictator substituting himself for the Central Committee.\u201d</p><p>The irony was that Trotsky and the Menshevik leader Martov had had no problem with Lenin\u2019s \u201cWhat Is To Be Done?\u201d for a whole year before the conference split! They did an about turn and found new \u201cprinciples\u201d so they could contrast their trend to Lenin\u2019s. It was only after the conference they went looking for any argument that could be used against Lenin in order to defend their pandering to intellectuals\u2019 egos and hurt feelings. This was gross opportunism. The Mensheviks started a boycott and active sabotage of the new party and older intellectuals like Georgi Plekhanov gave in and let them onto the central bodies without any vote by members, leading to Lenin\u2019s resignation in protest at these undemocratic maneuvers.</p><p>Trotsky wrote on behalf of the Russian revolutionary intelligentsia, expressing their desire to continue leading the workers: \u201cAccording to Lenin\u2019s new philosophy\u2026 the proletariat only needs to have been through the \u201cschooling of the factory\u201d in order to give the intelligentsia\u2026 lessons in political discipline!\u2026 not the \u201cschool of the factory\u201d but the school of political life, in which the Russian proletariat penetrates only under the leadership \u2013 good or bad \u2013 of the social democratic intelligentsia.\u201d</p><p>Trotsky spent the next few years shifting back and forth between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, often criticising both. But when there\u2019s a tug of war and someone stands in the middle pulling both ways, they\u2019re not helping the revolutionary cause. He tried to bring all the factions who opposed the Bolsheviks together into an eclectic alliance which soon fell apart. \u201dTrotsky groups all the enemies of Marxism\u201d wrote Lenin. When Lenin later criticised Menshevik deputies elected to the Tsarist Duma (a parliament), Trotsky condemned Lenin and said that Lenin\u2019s criticism of the party\u2019s parliamentary work threatened a split, Lenin replied: \u201cIs it not monstrous to see something offensive in a calm acknowledgement of mistakes\u2026 Does this not show the sickness in our Party?\u201d Lenin\u2019s attitude was that the workers should be in on every debate.</p>",

    "content_html": "<p>What would a working class revolution actually look like?</p><p>When you say Ireland needs a revolution people often don\u2019t understand exactly what you mean. It conjures up images of a small group of people storming the GPO and hoping for the best. But a working class revolution is about a massive show of people power because the path to a new society is in part shaped by how you get there.</p><p>Imagine the water charges movement but even bigger and more sustained. Now imagine that accompanied by mass strikes by workers, shutting down the flow of profit to the greedy bosses. A strike that covered the whole country would have to be coordinated, that would mean forming committees to organise that coordinated action.</p><p>In past revolutions like in Russia in 1905 and 1917 or in Chile in 1973 workers formed their own democratic mass assemblies, they were called \u201cSoviets\u201d in Russia and \u201cCordones\u201d in Chile. They democratically coordinated the working class fightback.</p><p>Moderate and middle class socialists saw these assemblies merely as a way to fight but not as the embryo of a new workers\u2019 state that was emerging from below. Revolutionary groups like the Russian Bolsheviks argued for \u201cAll Power To The Soviets!\u201d encouraging workers to keep fighting until all the bosses and landlords were kicked out of power.</p><p>The bosses have economic and political power. If you just occupy the workplaces but leave the state intact they\u2019ll come evict you. If you challenge state power without the backing of strikes in workplaces you are weakened and you don\u2019t create the embryo of a new alternative state power.</p><p>A severe economic or political crisis can provoke massive shows of people power - as we saw after the bank bailouts in 2008, but the system can rely on their state machine to use two key methods of control to stop a revolution, they\u2019ll use the carrot and the stick.</p><p>They can call new elections to try divert people from the streets and workplaces to the debate in parliament and when this fails they use force, sending the Guards in to evict workers who are occupying a workplace, or to confront protesters.</p><p>We saw the state in action during the Debenhams strike where they sent the riot squad in to remove workers who were just asking for their redundancy payments. Or just look at the campaign of slander they directed against a moderate challenge to their power when Catherine Connolly won the Presidency.</p><p>The Indignados movement in Spain saw tens of thousands occupy squares across the country but when the ruling class called elections the street movement, which had no clear political wing, was disoriented.</p><p>While having no party of their own can disarm workers, so can having the wrong type of party representing workers. In the final year of the 1960s there was a million and a half strike days lost as workers fought back with flying pickets and militant strikes.</p><p>Labour benefited from this explosion of militancy and they used this support to guide the movement back into safe channels, they went into coalition with Fine Gael in 1973 and demoralised the workers preparing the ground for the return of Fianna F\u00e1il in 1977.</p><p>Often concessions are made with the clear intention of disarming the movement and then when the level of militancy falls back they move against those who are still fighting.</p><p>In the case of the Russian Revolution of 1905 the ruthless Tsarist regime offered a parliament to calm the workers - the liberals and moderate socialists jumped for this carrot, at the same time the Tsar had his secret police organised pogroms, a campaign of mass murder, against Jewish workers and the left.</p><p>In Greece the radical left party Syriza formed a government and then backtracked on all their promises when threatened by the EU and the Greek rich. This demoralised workers and led to a collapse in the level of protest.</p><p>We saw the same thing in miniature here in Ireland when the water charges movement challenged Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael and they offered Marriage Equality and Repeal to seem like they were making concessions to progress. They were just trying to shore up their voter base to keep the show on the road.</p>",
