    "content_html": "<p>Cllr Madeleine Johansson looks at the government\u2019s new housing plan and shows it just repackages the same old Fianna F\u00e1il Fine Gael failures.</p><p>The government\u2019s new housing plan, published this week, is just more of the same. They try to dazzle us with numbers but as soon as you scratch the surface you see that this is a just continuation of their policy of handouts for developers and landlords - and consquently a continuation of the housing crisis for the working class.</p><p>While the target for new homes has increased to 300,000 by 2030 there are no substantial changes in how these will be delivered. The reliance on the private market continues with a target of only 12,000 new social homes a year. That\u2019s only 72,000 social housing units when there\u2019s already more than 147,000 in need of social housing between those on council housing lists and on HAP and RAS.</p><p>There is no plan to house all those people who need homes. The 12,000 doesn\u2019t even represent much of an increase when compared to their pathetic delivery of 11,900 in 2023 and 10,600 in 2024. That\u2019s they\u2019ve scrapped yearly targets - they know they\u2019ll just miss them again and again.</p><p>In the new plan the government boasts about their previous plan \u201cHousing For All\u201d and the 137,000 new homes built since 2021. However, if you compare these figures to previous years they\u2019re well below the high point of home building during the Celtic Tiger with almost 90,000 new homes built in 2007 alone.</p><p>There is a recognition that housing is a EU wide problem. But they can\u2019t talk about why this is happening, which is because of the privatisation of housing all across Europe. The plan intends to simply continue this neoliberal approach. They say that \u201cDelivering Homes, Building Communities presents a renewed environment for private sector investment and development to deliver more homes.\u201d</p><p>Part of this pandering to developers is a further reduction in apartment standards, which come on top of those that have already been introduced, and the changes in rent levels where rents can now be increased to completely unaffordable market levels for new tenancies.</p><p>There is more money for developers through a VAT reduction on apartments and further corporation tax reductions, both of which were already introduced in the 2026 Budget.</p><p>The re-zoning of more land for housing had already been started by local councils. This could become a cash cow for land owners who hoard land. They say that they will be \u201cenforcing the Residential Zoned Land Tax; and strengthening the use of Compulsory Purchase Orders\u201d but no details are included of how this will be done.</p><p>Land re-zoning has been more about enabling the profiteering of developers than providing housing. Those who have hoarded land will now line up to make a killing.</p><p>There\u2019s increased funding of \u20ac2.5 billion to the Land Development Agency to continue \u201cworking in partnership to deliver more homes across all tenures, including social and private; backing more Small and Medium Enterprise housing developers\u201d. More public money being spent on developers to build private houses!</p><p>Also, we\u2019ve already heard how the government is intending to privatise the development of new standalone wastewater treatment plants to bolster the service provided by Uisce \u00c9ireann.</p><p>They\u2019re also talking about reviewing the development contribution process. This is about the fees charged by local councils to developers for the provision of parks, community and other local services. It says it \u201cwill consider the impact of contributions on the viability of housing projects.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s code for another giveaway to developers with a loss of public services and amenities for ordinary people.</p><p>In terms of lifelines for those facing eviction such as the tenant in situ scheme it\u2019s non-existent in this plan. Government has already cut funding for the scheme. There\u2019s no ban on evictions and there\u2019s only one sentence that says:</p><p>\u201cIn respect of tenancy sustainment the acquisitions programme will continue to act as a necessary last resort policy tool available to local authorities to help prevent individuals or families falling into homelessness.\u201d</p>",

    "content_html": "<p>Council tenants face a proposed rent hike by the council who claim it\u2019s to pay for maintenance</p><p>Tenants in social housing across Dublin City Council face rent hikes with a proposal to raise rents from 15% of income to 18%. They also want to hit subsiduary earners in each household with a higher rate of rent.</p><p>This would see many of the poorest working class families in Dublin hit with higher rents in the middle of a cost of living crisis.</p><p>Many people in council housing spent 15 to 20 years on housing lists or years in homeless accommodation to eventually get into social housing and for many low paid working families the low rent rate provides a chance to save a little for the first time in their lives.</p><p>Taking \u20ac5 a week from someone on disability allowance or an extra \u20ac50 or more from a working family is a big deal when food and energy prices are through the roof. If someone working is on \u20ac400 a week and lives alone they can expect a 14% increase.</p><p>If they live with two adult earners the rent will increase by 47%, but if there are four additional adults in the house, the rent will rise by 60%!</p><p>The council claim that rents haven\u2019t risen in 30 years but that\u2019s not true because the rents have always been a percentage of income which means that as wages and welfare payments have risen over the years so has the rent each persons pays in absolute numbers.</p><p>The council says they need the money to pay for maintaining council estates but central government has spent 40 years intentionally running down our estates in order to drive people into the private market to rent or to buy.</p><p>I remember growing up in Fatima Mansions flats how the government offered people a carrot and a stick. They brought in the surrender grant to entice workers to leave social housing and then they used the stick of running down the estates to make people want to leave.</p><p>They took the live in caretakers out of many estates as social housing building collapsed in the 1980s as government after government pandered to the private markets. The results are still with us to this day.</p><p>The council claims the gap in funding for housing maintenance and annual income is \u20ac55.5 million. The rent changes would steal an additional income of \u20ac35.5 million by picking the pockets of the poor.</p><p>Now they want council tenants to take food out of their kids mouths in order to pay for maintaining estates that were intentionally run down by government.</p><p>The councils have other revenue raising powers - they could raise rates on big businesses, they could go after developers and landlords who leave sites derelict or vacant, they could demand funding from central government.</p><p>The council made \u20ac401.5 million from rates on businesses in 2024. They haven\u2019t been collecting the vacant site tax - they received a single payment of \u20ac1.7 million from the Dublin Port Company but hundreds of landlords and developers haven\u2019t coughed up a cent!</p><p>The council is owed tens of millions for these vacant sites, far more than the money they\u2019re trying to take from council tenants. Why not take this seriously? Collect the money owed and push sites back into use to tackle the housing crisis.</p><p>Tenants from council housing from a few estates have come together to call a protest outside the full council meeting on Monday December 1st at City Hall on Dame Street Dublin at 6pm.</p>",
